# Cprog_logic
Contains the code for basic, intermediate, advanced and challenge level questions 

## Basic Level:
1. Write a program to check if a number is palindrome (e.g., 121 → palindrome, 123 → not).
2. Find the factorial of a number using both loop and recursion
3. Write a program to find the sum of digits of a number (e.g., 123 → 6).
4. Check if a number is prime or not
5. Print the fibonnacci series up to n terms (loop+ revursion versions)
6. Find the GCD and LCM of two numbers.
7. Swap two numbers with and without a temporary variable
8. Check if a number is Armstrong number (eg 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3)

## Intermediate Level
1. Reverse an array of integers.
2. Find the largest and smallest element in an array.
3. Remove duplicate elements from an array.
4. Implement linear search and binary search.
5. Implement bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.
6. Count the frequency of characters in a string.
7. Check if a string is a palindrome.
8. Find the longest word in a sentence

## Advance LevelImplement a function to reverse a string using pointers.
1. Write a program to sort an array using pointers.
2. Implement a matrix multiplication program.
3. Transpose a matrix in place.
4. Writ a program to dynamically allocate memory for an array using malloc and find its average.
5. Implement a program to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
6. Implement a stack using arrays.
7. Implement a queue using arrays

## Challenge Level
1. Define a structure for student details (name,roll, marks) and sort students by marks
2. Write a program to store employee details in a file and read them back.
3. Implement a program that copies the contents of one file into another
4. Implement a singly linked list with insert and delete operations
5. Write a program to reverse a linked list
6. Implement a program to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack.
