1. Write a program to check if a number is palindrome (e.g., 121 → palindrome, 123 → not).
2. Find the factorial of a number using both loop and recursion
3. Write a program to find the sum of digits of a number (e.g., 123 → 6).
4. Check if a number is prime or not
5. Print the fibonnacci series up to n terms (loop+ revursion versions)
6. Find the GCD and LCM of two numbers.
7. Swap two numbers with and without a temporary variable
8. Check if a number is Armstrong number (eg 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3)
